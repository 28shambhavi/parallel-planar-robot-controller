## Implementing model based controllers on a 3 RPS parallel planar platform

The coordinates of the upper platform are calculated by performing kinematic analysis on the system. Linear actuators are connected to the legs using passive joints. Further, static analysis will help choose a suitable LA for fabrication. Upon choosing a linear actuator, a controller can be devised for the resulting system. The project is a work in progress.
